# web-app-2020-fall

> Example of a collaborative MVC web app built with the Express web framework for Node.js.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (comes with npm)
- Git
- TortoiseGit
- VS Code
- VS Code Extension - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)

## Background

- Express-generator with EJS
- Change var to const
- Change package.json versions to "latest"
- Added folders for MVC
- Updated to use express app4 updates
- [Set up ESLint and Prettier](https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-to-setup-eslint-and-prettier-on-node)
- Set up [Cypress](https://docs.cypress.io/) testing

## Adding Resources

Follow conventions - use standard lowercase, no spaces, follow naming patterns

We want to be able to perform all CRUD options (create, read, update, delete)

- Make a model
- Make a controller
- Make a views subfolder with 5 views:

1. create.ejs
1. delete.ejs
1. details.ejs
1. edit.ejs
1. index.ejs

On your initial commit, just add a comment block at the top of each file.

Add yourself and your email as the author (follow the examples).

## Contributing

1. Pull fresh code. (Fork & clone if this is the first time.)
1. Run npm install
1. Run npm start dev
1. Verify everything runs.
1. Make your local edits.
1. Git add & git commit locally.
1. Git push to the origin.
1. Submit your pull request to the main repo.

As you test your code, format it with Prettier and
lint (clean it up) with ESLint.
See scripts in package.json.
